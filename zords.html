    <p>The Thundersaurus Megazord is the primary Megazord formation utilized by the trio Conner McKnight, Ethan James, and Kira Ford</p>
    <p>This Megazord formation consists of the zords, Tyrannozord from Connor, Tricerazord from Ethan, and Pterazord from Kira.</p>
    <p>The Tyrannazord tail can be removed and turned into a lance styled weapon. The Triverazord head can be used as a shield and also has a pincer-like function due to the horns on the head of the Tricerazord.</p>
    <p>There are other formations as the Rangers discover more dinosaur based megazords throughout the series and add them to the Dino Thunder team's Megazord hangar.</p>
