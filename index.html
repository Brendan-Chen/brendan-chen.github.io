					<tr>
						<td>T-Rex Speed</td>
						<td>Due to the Red Dino Gem, Conner has the power to move and react at superhuman speeds. This includes his physical speed, reaction time, and reflexes. His maximum speed is unknown, but somewhere along the regions of the speed of sound. When using his powers, everything in normal motion appears to slow down to his perspective, while he accelerates to his opponent's.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Tricera Skin</td>
						<td>Due to the Blue Dino Gem, Ethan has the power to make his skin impenetrable and as hard as a rock, similar to the scales of a Triceratops. His skin turns scale-like and goes blue when he uses this power.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Ptera Scream</td>
						<td>Due to the powers of the Yellow Dino Gem, Kira is able to emit a destructive sonic scream from her vocal cords that has enough power to flatten anything in the scream's path. As a sound-based attack, it also has the added effect of harming the target's hearing.</td>
